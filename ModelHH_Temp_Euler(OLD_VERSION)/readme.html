--------------------OLD VERSION-----------------------
Here we try to implemente the temperature in the HH model by using the Euler methode. It didn't work. Apparently, using the Euler method is not very good at this point, it is the reason
why we change the model.

If you want to run the code:
- Run the main

Note: only one version of the temperature vector is given here (test_model_T.m) but many other solutions have been tried.
