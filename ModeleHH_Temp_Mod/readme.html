This is the readme for the modified model to get different graphs and to play with the parameters to get the data:

There are different main code that you can run and change the values to play with different parameters of the code:

- diffusion_chaleur_main.m : Allow to get the distribution of the temperature along the axon
- change_temp_peak_main.m : Allow to play with the delta T to see the affect of the different temperature value on the production of AP
- hh_temperature_excite.m : Allow to get the value of the membrane at a specific location and show it on a graph
- different_rising_time.m : Allow to play with the rising time parameters
